# heart-disease-prediction-xgboost-SHAP
This project predicts 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk using the Framingham Heart Study dataset and XGBoost. After preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved 85.85% accuracy. SHAP is used for model explainability. Great for exploring machine learning in health data!
